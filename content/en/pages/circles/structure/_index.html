  What is our structure?
  
  The IDN is organized in circles that link with each other via two delegates. We have Working Group Circles (in green) that are organized by theme and Continental Circles (in red) that are organized by geographical region. We also have the organising circle (in blue), which helps the internal functioning of the IDN. The diagram below is dynamic, so you can click on each circle and learn more about their purpose, responsibilities and domains.
