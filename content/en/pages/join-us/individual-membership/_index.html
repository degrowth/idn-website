If your organisation hasn’t joined yet, consider joining via our <a href="https://degrowth.net/join-us/group-membership/">group membership page.</a>  Once you belong to one of IDN's member organisations, you will be connected to the rest of the IDN through the people your organisation has selected to be its delegates.</li> <i>(You may also want to browse this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18Z7kTs0smhOU9S3DyGNJ_MBQeu3XKW2qdxa3unOEn6I/edit?usp=sharing">database</a> of hundreds of degrowth groups and contact them directly to see how to get involved with them, but please note that not all groups have applied to become members of the IDN or have agreed to our principles yet.)</i><br><br><li> <b>Join as an individual member.</b> If you would like to get involved in the IDN directly, you may join one of the <a href="https://degrowth.net/structure/">Circles listed here</a> by filling out the form below.</li> </ol><p>Before applying for membership, please make sure you’ve read and agree with the <a href="https://degrowth.net/about/principles/">IDN principles</a> and have a basic understanding of the overall IDN structure.
