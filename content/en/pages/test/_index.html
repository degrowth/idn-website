        <p><b>Degrowth vs. Recession</b><br>Degrowth isn't about economic decline; it's a conscious shift from GDP-focused growth to enhancing life quality. Unlike a recession, which is unintentional and harmful, degrowth is a deliberate, positive change which puts people and planet before profits. Degrowth then acknowledges that this is likely to lead to a reduced GDP (although that is not the focus!).</p><p><b>Mini Capitalism? Think Again<br></b>Degrowth isn't capitalism on a diet. It’s not only about scaling down corporations or slowing down trade. It's a radical rethinking of our economic systems, focusing on local, regenerative, and community-based approaches, not just shrinking existing structures.</p><p><b>Innovation's New Frontier<br></b>Degrowth doesn’t stifle innovation; it redirects it. Instead of focusing on commercial gains, like creating faster trading algorithms, it emphasises innovations that solve real community challenges, such as developing local currencies, improving renewable energy technology, shared resource network/appss, medicinal advances, or community resilience technologies.</p><p><b>Human Nature and True Progress<br></b>Is our nature to progress? Yes. But degrowth argues that progress isn’t about accumulating wealth, power and status. Degrowth seeks to redefine progress to mean the enhancement of collective well-being, and ecological stability not just individual accumulation.</p>
