        <p>The IDN has adopted sociocracy as its overall governing structure, based on the following principles:</p><p><b>The Principle of Circles</b></p><p>The governance structure of the IDN shall consist of numerous working groups or organisations, called Circles. A Circle is defined as a group of people fulfilling specific roles and cooperating for a common purpose. All Circles shall have a clearly defined purpose, responsibilities, and domain.and  be double-linked to at least one other Circle.</p><p><b>The Principle of Consent</b></p><p>All policy decisions, including the selection of people for Circle roles, shall be made through a process of consent that involves those directly affected. Achieving consent shall be conducted in a way to ensure that all members’ input is heard (e.g. via rounds). Members consent to a decision when there are no reasoned objections to a proposal. </p><p><b>The Principle of Equivalence</b></p><p>Making and reviewing decisions shall involve people that are affected by them. All Circles, and their members, shall have an equal say and any member of a Circle may make a proposal.</p><p><b>The Principle of Continuous Evolution </b></p><p>The IDN as a whole, and each Circle in particular, shall be committed to ongoing feedback and continual learning about governance, communication, and the content of the Circles’ work. All policy decisions, including selections of people for roles, shall be scheduled for feedback and review after a deﬁned period of time (its term) and may be re-evaluated at any time. Circles and members are also encouraged to test new proposals through experimentation. </p><p><b>The Principle of Transparency</b></p><p>Circles shall record all information that is valuable for the IDN and make it accessible to all IDN members unless the Circle determines that there is a good reason for confidentiality.</p><p><b>The Principle of Effectiveness</b></p><p>Circles should devote time only to what brings the Circle and its members closer to achieving the purpose of the Circle.</p><p><b>The Principle of Accountability</b></p><p>Circles and their members should consider their capacities before taking on a new responsibility, so they are able to fulfil tasks they committed to. They should strive to improve the IDN and take responsibility for their work and the IDN as a whole.</p>

        <p>The IDN is organized in circles that link with each other via two delegates. We have Working Group Circles (in green) that are organized by theme and Continental Circles (in red) that are organized by geographical region. We also have the organising circle (in blue), which helps the internal functioning of the IDN. The diagram below is dynamic, so you can click on each circle and learn more about their purpose, responsibilities and domains. </p>
