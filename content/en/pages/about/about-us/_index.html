        <p>Many people in the degrowth movement have worked hard to build community and connection between groups and across borders - whether through an annual Degrowth Conference or through the more informal Degrowth Assemblies that often accompany them. During these Assemblies, representatives from various degrowth groups met to connect with each other and organise, but structuring a movement that is diverse and spread across the globe has always been a huge challenge. Degrowth groups needed a way to collaborate and provide the degrowth movement a consistent voice without jeopardising its plurality. Communication within the movement needs to flow between groups and regions to enable cooperation. This has proved challenging because groups have uneven capacities, with many run by time-constrained volunteers. Without clear information on the work of different degrowth groups, it has been impossible to give a truthful representation of the Movement and to distribute resources fairly. </p><p><br>Wanting to take on these challenges, the 2022 Assembly in Vienna created an open collective called the Organising the Degrowth Network (ODN), which was mandated to propose a structure for an international degrowth network. After a year’s worth of conversations, research, and integrating feedback, the ODN presented its <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19HpNRpiplPdkW3y-APh_yU3JkYJG1O3W/view?usp=drive_link">proposal</a> to the Fourth Assembly of the Degrowth Movement in Zagreb in 2023. On August 28th, nearly 100 individuals representing over 25 degrowth groups and organisations from around the world gathered to discuss the proposed network's structure, transparency, decision-making processes, and the place of a formalised network within the future of the degrowth movement. The Assembly concluded by adopting the proposal and officially launching the International Degrowth Network (IDN) with dedicated Circles committed to improving it within the next year. </p>
