        <p>On August 28th 2023, the Fourth International Degrowth Assembly gathered nearly 100 degrowth activists, academics, practitioners and artists from around the world to discuss the future of the degrowth movement and create a formalised network. We discussed the network's structure and its transparency, in order to enable better collaboration throughout the network and better democratic decision-making. The <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IVB3vS7jP9SMzlu3xUM2LbU6eEHcsRh4/view?usp=drive_link">Zagreb Proposal</a> was adopted by the Assembly, and dedicated circles were created to improve it within the next year. <br></p>
