        <p><b></b></p><p>Degrowth suggests shifting away from economic growth as the main measure of success and well-being in societies.</p><p>The constant pursuit of economic growth harms the environment, uses up resources, and creates social inequality.</p><p>Degrowth asks that we pay attention to other signs of well-being, like quality of life, fairness, and environmental sustainability. To do this, we need to rethink our current economic system, question the idea that economic growth is crucial, and consider different models that put human well-being, autonomy, and environmental health first. This will mean changing how we consume and work, and what values our society prioritises.</p>
