        <p>Degrowth advocates for a move away from the traditional emphasis on economic growth as a primary indicator of success and well-being.</p><p>The pursuit of endless economic growth leads to environmental degradation, resource depletion and social inequality. Degrowth proposes that we focus on alternative indicators of well-being, such as quality of life, social justice, and environmental sustainability.</p><p>The degrowth movement suggests rethinking the current economic system, challenging the notion that continuous growth is essential, and exploring alternative models that prioritise human well-being and ecological sustainability. This will involve changes in consumption patterns, work structures, and societal values to create a more resilient and equitable society.</p>
