<p>Cargonomia works as a partner in cooperation with Zsámboki Biokert (collectively as part of The Open Garden Foundation) in organic food distribution and community outreach programming. Cargonomia’s volunteers manage a cargo bicycle logistics centre and local food distribution point in Budapest, and work in close cooperation with the farm team. They have been collaborating to implement advocacy and educational outreach and DIY workshops focusing on urban sustainability, organic gardening and agroecology education, bicycle mobility, degrowth in practice, community activism for more liveable cities and self-sufficient living.<br></p>
